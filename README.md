## Gameplay

The game is a top-down shooter where players are divided into red and blue teams. Upon starting the game, players can choose to host a game or join as a client. Clients attempt to find available matches and join a lobby where they wait for the host to start the game. In the lobby, players can also switch between teams (red/blue). Hosts are taken directly to their lobby where they can change teams and initiate the game. Once the game starts, all players are teleported to the game scene where they can activate their weapons and start shooting by pressing SPACE.
